# River Canyon Heightmap 3D Model Maker

I started with the idea of being able to 3D print a heightmap of the Rogue River canyon. I decided to try to build a more general solution to this problem so that you could apply this to any river. In its current state it is a bit all over the place and not super clean. I may attempt to revisit this and create a webpage out of it for an easier-to-use user experience.
